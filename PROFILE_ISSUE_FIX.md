# Fix for Profile Display Issue - UPDATED

## Problem Summary
Your application is showing:
- **0 credits** instead of 25 Find + 25 Verify credits
- **Email address** instead of full name "Twinkal shah"
- **Billing page errors**

## ‚úÖ RLS Policies Applied Successfully
I can see from your Supabase dashboard that the RLS policies have been created correctly:
- "Users can view own profile" (SELECT)
- "Users can update own profile" (UPDATE) 
- "Users can insert own profile" (INSERT)

## üîß Required Steps to Fix the Issue

### Step 1: Clear Browser Data (CRITICAL)
The application is still using cached authentication data that doesn't work with the new RLS policies.

**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Right-click the refresh button ‚Üí **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**
3. Or go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear browsing data ‚Üí Select "Cookies" and "Cached images and files"

**Safari:**
1. Go to Safari ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Manage Website Data
2. Remove data for `mailsfinder.com` and `app.mailsfinder.com`
3. Or use `Cmd+Option+E` to empty caches

**Firefox:**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` on Mac)
2. Select "Cookies" and "Cache"
3. Clear data for the last hour

### Step 2: Complete Logout and Login
1. **Log out completely** from your application
2. **Close all browser tabs** related to mailsfinder.com
3. **Wait 30 seconds**
4. **Open a fresh browser tab**
5. **Log back in** to your application

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
After logging back in, check:
- ‚úÖ Header shows **"Twinkal shah"** instead of email
- ‚úÖ Credits show **"Find: 25, Verify: 25"** instead of 0
- ‚úÖ Billing page loads without errors
- ‚úÖ No "Error fetching user profile" in browser console

## üö® If Issue Still Persists

### Option A: Force Session Refresh
1. Open browser Developer Tools (`F12`)
2. Go to **Application** tab ‚Üí **Storage** ‚Üí **Clear storage**
3. Check all boxes and click **"Clear site data"**
4. Refresh the page and log in again

### Option B: Check for JavaScript Errors
1. Open browser console (`F12` ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Look for any red error messages
3. If you see errors related to "Invalid URL" or "fetch failed", there might be environment variable issues

### Option C: Verify Environment Variables
Check that your application has the correct Supabase configuration:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` should point to your Supabase project
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` should be the anonymous key from your project settings

## üîç Technical Details

### What Was Wrong
- RLS was enabled on `profiles` table but no policies existed
- Authenticated users couldn't read their own profile data
- The `useRealTimeCredits` hook was failing silently

### What the Fix Does
- Creates RLS policies allowing users to access their own profiles
- Uses `auth.uid() = id` to ensure secure access
- Enables proper data flow to React components

### Why Browser Refresh is Critical
- Browser cached the failed authentication state
- Old session tokens don't work with new RLS policies
- Fresh login creates new session with proper permissions

## üìã Verification Checklist

After completing all steps, verify:
- [ ] Browser cache cleared
- [ ] Logged out completely
- [ ] Logged back in with fresh session
- [ ] Header shows full name "Twinkal shah"
- [ ] Credits show "Find: 25, Verify: 25"
- [ ] Billing page loads successfully
- [ ] No console errors related to profile fetching

## üÜò Still Need Help?

If the issue persists after following all steps:
1. Take a screenshot of the browser console errors
2. Check if you can see your profile data in Supabase dashboard
3. Verify that the RLS policies are still active in your Supabase project

**The RLS policies are correctly applied. The issue should resolve after clearing browser cache and logging in with a fresh session.**
